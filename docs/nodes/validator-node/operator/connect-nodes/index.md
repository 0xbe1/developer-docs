# Connect Nodes

:::caution Node deployment
Before you can connect your nodes to the Aptos network, you will need to deploy them. Make sure to have
deployed your nodes using one of the [deployment methods](../running-validator-node/index.md) before proceeding.
:::

Once you have deployed your validator and validator fullnode (VFN) using one of the deployment methods, you will need to
connect them to the Aptos network. This requires initializing your staking pool and joining the validator set. If you
do not complete these steps, your nodes will not be able to connect to other nodes in the network.

Follow the [Connect to a Network](../connect-to-aptos-network.md) guide to get started.
